## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

This "bike sharing" dataset is provided by "Capital Bikeshare", Metro DC's bikeshare service, who launched in 2010. They created this dataset in order to assess usage trends and plan expansion.  There are two csv files in the data folder: hour.csv and day.csv. The fields included in these data files are date, season, year, month, hour, holiday, day of the week, the weather, temperture, humidity, windspeed, casual users, registered users, and count of total rental bikes. The data has been processed in order to ensure there are no trips less than 60 seconds. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We thought this would be a really interesting dataset to use for our project becuase we believe that these bikesharing services are a really great idea! We all love biking, and believe that these services are really useful for people who dont have a car, or those who are trying to reduce their carbon footprint! For our dashboard, maybe we could create some kind of cool interactive map that showcases the data.
